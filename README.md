## **📌 Project Overview**  
**Open-Seq-Me** automates the handling of **FLO-MIN 114 flow cells**, eliminating manual steps in sequencing workflows. This system ensures **precision, efficiency, and biosafety** by streamlining the process from **package opening to insertion into the MinION sequencer** (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).  

## **🎯 Problem Statement**  
Manual handling of sequencing devices is time-consuming, error-prone, and risks contamination. **Automating bio-surveillance workflows** is essential to reduce sample-to-answer time, especially in high-throughput environments. Open-Seq-Me addresses these challenges by offering a **fully automated, damage-free flow cell handling system**.  

## **🔧 Our Solution**
We built a working prototype combining mechanical automation and robotics to streamline this process:

✅ Mechanical gear-drive system clamps and transports packets from a vertical stack.
✅ Laser cutting & vibration-based separation safely removes packaging without damaging the flow cell.
✅ 6-DOF robotic arm grips the casing, removes the cover, retrieves the flow cell, and inserts it into the sequencer.
✅ Automated waste disposal ensures proper handling of discarded packaging.

## **🛠 Key Features**  
✅ **Automated package handling** with a mechanical chain-drive system  
✅ **Laser cutting & vibration-based separation** for precise opening  
✅ **6-DOF robotic arm** for safe flow cell retrieval & insertion  
✅ **Sequoia AI assistant** for guided onboarding & secure operation  
✅ **Automated waste disposal** for packaging material  

## **🔧 Technologies Used**  
- **Robotics & Automation**: 6-DOF robotic arm for precise handling  
- **Mechanical Design**: Gear-driven clamps and chain-drive system  
- **Computer Vision & AI**: Sequoia AI assistant for secure guidance  
- **Precision Cutting**: Laser cutting and vibration-based separation
